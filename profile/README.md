# Rocket Gravimetric Espresso

Rocket Gravimetric Espresso is a personal project aimed at modifying my Rocket Espresso machine into a gravimetric (brew-by-weight) machine.
This allows precise measurement and control of espresso extraction, improving consistency and precision in every shot.

## Features

- Brew-by-Weight Control: The system monitors the espresso shotâ€™s weight in real-time and automatically stops the extraction when the desired ratio is reached.
- UI: A responsive TFT touchscreen interface for data on shot weight, extraction time, and shot settings.

## Hardware used

- MCU: Nordic nRF52840
- TFT touch: Adafruit 2.8" Capacitive
- SparkFun 500g load cells
- HX711 cell amp
- Relay?

## Software and tools

- Zephyr RTOS for firmware
- KiCAD for PCB design
